   Warning: Atom names in each residue should be unique.
     (Same-name atoms are handled by using the first
      occurrence and by ignoring the rest.
      Frequently duplicate atom names stem from alternate
      conformations in the PDB file.)

   Warning: Atom names in each residue should be unique.

      occurrence and by ignoring the rest.
      Frequently duplicate atom names stem from alternate

   Warning: Atom names in each residue should be unique.

      occurrence and by ignoring the rest.
      Frequently duplicate atom names stem from alternate

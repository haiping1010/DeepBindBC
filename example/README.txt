Thank you for downloading the Astex Diverse Set!


Each of the 85 directories contains the following files:


     - ligand.mol              

       An MDL MOL file of the ligand.
       This serves as both the input and the reference file.

     - protein.mol2

       A SYBYL MOL2 file for the protein


     - protein_opt_h_gs.mol2

       A SYBYL MOL2 file for the protein for which the flexible
       hydrogen atoms on Ser/Thr/Tyr/Lys residues have been
       optimised with the GoldScore function.


     - protein_opt_h_cs.mol2
                               
       A SYBYL MOL2 file for the protein for which the flexible
       hydrogen atoms on Ser/Thr/Tyr/Lys residues have been
       optimised with the ChemScore function.


Further information on how these files were generated is given in
the J.Med.Chem paper on the Astex Diverse Set (full reference to
be inserted here when available).
